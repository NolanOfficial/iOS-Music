# iOS-Music
An app that plays music from your Music Library. 

## What I Learned
* Importing MediaPlayer and configuring the music player controller
* Requesting authorization from the media library
* Creating a volume view to allow for adjustments of volume through a slide bar 
* Changing all labels to the correct information based on the corresponding song
* Using Media Query and Media Property Predicate to allow for genre selection
